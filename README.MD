# TFL_ACNE_DETECTION

This project aims to detect acne using Transfer Learning with TensorFlow.

## About

This project utilizes transfer learning, a technique in machine learning where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task. In this case, we use a pre-trained model as the base and fine-tune it to detect acne on facial images.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NafMn/TFL_ACNE_DETECTION.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the script for acne detection:
    ```
    python detect_acne.py
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found at [URL_DATASET]. It contains facial images with annotations for acne presence.
